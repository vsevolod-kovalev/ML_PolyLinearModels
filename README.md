# Polynomial and Linear Regression models using NumPy.

This project implements **linear** and **polynomial regression** models in pure Python and NumPy, focusing on the educational aspects of machine learning fundamentals.

## ðŸ“š Key Features

1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE) Calculation**: 
   - Understand model performance by calculating the average squared error of predictions.

2. **Gradient Descent Optimization**:
   - Learn how gradient descent adjusts weights and biases iteratively to minimize error.
   - Supports both linear and polynomial regression.

3. **Polynomial Feature Engineering**:
   - Generate higher-degree features to fit complex patterns in data

4. **Simple Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load data from CSV files and extract relevant features and target values.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Compare model predictions with actual data points using basic visualizations to assess model fit.
